//Challenge Questions
//1) Filter all presidents, leaving only the Democratic ones
const democratic = presidents.filter((presidents) => presidents.party === "D");
console.table(democratic);

//2)Filter all presidents to leave only one term Republican presidents HINT use If statement
const republicanOneTerm = presidents.filter(
  (presidents) => presidents.party === "R" && presidents.terms === 1
);
console.table(republicanOneTerm);

//3) return only the last three presidents
const lastThree = presidents.slice(0, 3);
console.table(lastThree);

//4) log all dems who served 2 terms. HINT use chain filter, filter and slice
const democrat = presidents.filter((presidents) => presidents.party === "D");
const democraticTwoTerms = democrat.filter((democrat) => democrat.terms === 2);
console.log(democraticTwoTerms);

//BONUS write a script to check if LBJ was a 2 term president. IF he was then alert("LBJ served two terms") else alert "LBJ was one and done"
